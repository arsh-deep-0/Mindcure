# Mindcure
our app is  a based on a very simple idea that our to improve mental health , we need to hear different types of music 
for different situations and different time of a day.
so it asks user some simple questions and on the basics of it calcualates his/her energy level and sugggests them :
1.productivity music if energy level is high 
2.if energy level is low ,it asks them to take rest and recommends them a soothing music for better a better nap.
3.there are some other music also in the app to access for user

In future we are planning to add other quizes such as mood tracker  or  a social-skills enhancer cum tracker to our app 
which wil use machine learning to know the music listening habits of the users on the basis of which it will it can
recommend better music to user for specific situations.
